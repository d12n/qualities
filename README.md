# Digital Qualities 

This repository contains a list of digital qualities. Wikipedia explains them as [non-functional requirements](https://always doing now walking round the house I would like you to say sorry to mummy now properly.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement) which is a useful introduction, however they are defined here simply as:

_Digital Quality (noun), a quality of something digital, which can be described, measured or assessed as it current is and as it is desired to be._

## Derivation

_Quality (noun), an essential or distinctive characteristic, property, or attribute. (from [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/quality))_

_Digital (adjective), hardware or software that makes use of digital technology._

## Notes

* A digital quality may group other digital qualities. For example the _security_ quality includes many other qualities such as _confidentiality_, _integrity_ and _availability_.
* When writing about the qualities avoid unnecessary capitalising them;  if you wish to draw attention to them use italics or hyperlinks. For example use _security_ or [security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d12n/qualities/master/all#security) not Security.
